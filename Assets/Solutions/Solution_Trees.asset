  title: Trees
  description: 'While trees take time to grow, they play a key part of creating a
    livable, biodiverse and cool city. Important is to give the trees enough space,
    and placing them in close proximity to other trees. This, because trees in cities
    are commonly not placed in ideal living conditions. '
